## About Me

### Experience
</br>
It is a pleasant experience for me to participate in this project, where I have achieved many beautiful things, from which I have been able to learn a lot. </br></br>
I realized that I am not so good and I need to practice more and more.
It was more complicated for me to work with an API other than firebase. 
</br></br>
Since my time was limited by college, I will try to continue this project to lead it to improvement, so I will need your help. If you have an idea, notice a bug or an improvement, please suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
